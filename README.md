# RESTful-design
This repo tracks work done while following Kevin Dockx's courses on Pluralsight. These courses explore what it means for an API to be RESTful and how to properly implment a RESTful API using ASP.NET Core 3. The first course led me through level 0-2 of the Richardson Maturity Model for an API. Along the way I learned more about the .NET Core Framework and the differne infrastructure it provides to create well-crafter RESTful APIs.

The second course covers more complex topics such as HATEOAS(Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State), Concurrency, Caching, and more. You can see examples of these concepts and more in the src folder of this repository. 

### Disclaimer
This is not an original project and I do not claim any of this code as my own. I was merely following along with the courses and wanted to save my own documented version for future reference. If you would like to see the original code as writtin by Kevin Dockx you can find it at [this]() link.
